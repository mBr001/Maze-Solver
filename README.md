# Maze Solver
There are two Algorithms here which solve mazes. One of them is a Shortest Path Algorithm, the other, Minimal Tree Algorithm along with dead end filling.

The Shortest Path Algorithm takes longer, infact 10 times longer than Minimal Tree - Dead Ending Filling Algorithm.
But, 
The Dead Ending filling part of the algorithm may not work for all mazes. 


## Process
Both the Algorithms take images as input. But, with certain necessary conditions. 
1) The Entrance and the Exit of the maze must be closed and marked.
2) The Input image is prefered to be Black and White.
3) The Co-ordinates of the Entrance and the Exit in the image must be noted.
4) The gap between the walls must also be noted, since it is an input into the algorithm.

**Tree Diagram**
Both Algorithms draw a tree like graph.

**The Solution**
The Solution is then generated by Shortest Path tracing in Dijkstra Algorithm case and by Dead End Filling in the Minimal Tree Algorithm case.
