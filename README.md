# Maze-Solver
There are two Algorithms here which solve mazes. One of them is a Shortest Path Algorithm, the other, Minimal Tree Algorithm along with dead end filling.

The Shortest Path Algorithm takes longer, infact 10 times longer than Minimal Tree - Dead Ending Filling Algorithm.
But, 
The Dead Ending filling part of the algorithm may not work for all mazes.
